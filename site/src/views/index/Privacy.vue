      Worst Possible Answer does not by default store any data for longer than the duration of a single game.
      Player nicknames, chat messages, cards played, and any other information will be erased automatically once a
      game has ended, or in a once-hourly cleanup of idle games.

      From time to time it may be necessary to preserve game-related data in server logs to aid with debugging and development.
      This information will be retained for a maximum of thirty days, and will never be disclosed to a third party.
