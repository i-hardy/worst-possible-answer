    <p>
      To start a new game, hit the 'new game' button and choose a nickname for yourself. You will be taken to a
      game setup screen where you can pick card decks from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cardcastgame.com/">Cardcast</a>,
      and set how many points it will take to win the game. You'll also be shown the code you need to share with friends
      who want to join your game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have selected at least one deck and a win condition, and at least one other player has joined,
      you can hit the big red button and start the game!
    </p>
    <p>
      To join your friend's game, hit the 'join game' button, choose a nickname, and enter the code your friend gives you.
      You'll be taken to a waiting screen where you can chat with other people in the game and see what decks are being added.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can opt-in to receive audio notifications when a round starts, or when it's time to choose a card if you're the
      current card czar, and a notification from your browser to remind you to play a card.
